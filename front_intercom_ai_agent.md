## Step 3: Link Your Zendesk Account

Once registered, you'll proceed to link your Zendesk account with eesel AI. This step involves authorizing and granting eesel AI the required permissions to interact with your Zendesk setup.

## Step 4: Import Front Knowledge to eesel AI

It's now time to integrate your Front content into eesel AI. This knowledge base will act as the backbone for the AI agent's responses to customer inquiries within Zendesk.

1. In the eesel AI dashboard, go to the "Add Knowledge" area.
2. Incorporate your Front documentation either manually or through the eesel AI scraper for content that's publicly available.

## Step 5: Set Up Your AI Agent's Operation in Zendesk

With your Front knowledge base connected, adjust the operation of eesel AI within Zendesk. This encompasses configuring response triggers, choosing response formats (public reply or private note), and personalizing the AI agent's handling of your support tickets.

## Optional Adjustments

- **Response Configurations:** Customize eesel AI's response strategies, such as opting for always public answers or selecting based on particular triggers.
  
- **Manual Transfer:** Set up a mechanism for transferring conversations to human agents when the AI decides it's unable to resolve an inquiry satisfactorily.
